"As a marketing agency I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that our own site is optimized for search engines"

## Description
I did what the marketing agency asked and added the accessibility standards to the website to make it more user friendly and optimized for search engines. I also know 
that the golden rule for whenever recieveing any code, is to return it in better shape than when you got it. I condensed a lot of the CSS to make it easier to follow and not
be as long of a file. I also updated all of the HTML code with symantic HTML code. This will make it much easier for future developers to work on and understand thet layout
more effectviely.
